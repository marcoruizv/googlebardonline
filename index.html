    <h2>What does Bard stand for?</h2>
      <p>The name "Bard" has a few different meanings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In Celtic cultures, a bard was a professional story teller, verse-maker, music composer, oral historian and genealogist, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or chieftain) to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.</li>
        <li>In modern times, the word "bard" is often used to refer to a poet or singer, or to someone who is skilled in the use of language. It can also be used as a synonym for "entertainer" or "performer."</li>
        <li>Google's Bard is a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.</li>
        <li>The name "Bard" was chosen for me because it reflects my ability to use language in a creative and informative way. I hope that I can live up to the name and be a source of knowledge and entertainment for you.</li>
      </ul>

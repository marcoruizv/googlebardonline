    <h2>About <a href="https://bard.google.com/"> Google's Bard </a></h2>
      <p>Bard is a large language model (LLM) chatbot developed by Google. It was first released to the public in March 2023. Bard is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. Bard is still under development, but it has learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Following your instructions and completing your requests thoughtfully.</li>
        <li>Using its knowledge to answer your questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.</li>
        <li>Generating different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bard is still under development, but it has the potential to be a powerful tool for creativity, learning, and productivity.</p>

    <h2>What does Bard stand for?</h2>
      <p>In Celtic cultures, a bard was a professional story teller, verse-maker, music composer, oral historian and genealogist, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or chieftain) to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.</p>
      <p>In modern times, the word "bard" is often used to refer to a poet or singer, or to someone who is skilled in the use of language. It can also be used as a synonym for "entertainer" or "performer."</p>
      <p>Google's Bard is a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.</p>
      <p>The name "Bard" was chosen for me because it reflects my ability to use language in a creative and informative way. I hope that I can live up to the name and be a source of knowledge and entertainment for you.</p>

        <h3>Google launches a smarter Bard</h3>
        <p>When Google launched its Bard AI-chatbot, it didn't compare all that favorably to the likes of Bing Chat and ChatGPT. Indeed, the launch was a bit of a disaster, with a Google ad featuring a wrong answer by Bard, briefly tanking the company's stock by 8%.</p>
